<h2>3. Terms of Use</h2>
<p>a. You must not use the Service to distribute any Froody Cones in a manner inconsistent with the inherent randomness of the universe. Remember, ice cream is best enjoyed when least expected.</p>

<h2>5. Privacy and Zaphod Beeblebrox</h2>

<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>Under no circumstances shall Infinite Improbability Ice Cream be liable for any direct, indirect, or improbably random damages arising from the use or misuse of the Service. This includes, but is not limited to, melted ice cream on your digital devices, existential crises, or unexpected visits from Marvin the Paranoid Android.</p>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>
<p>Infinite Improbability Ice Cream reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time if you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions set forth herein, or if you lose your towel. Upon termination, all Froody Cones must be immediately consumed or disposed of in accordance with proper space-time protocols.</p>

<h2>8. Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>b. Should any part of this EULA be deemed improbable or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full effect.</p>
<p>c. Always remember to carry a towel and enjoy your Froody Cones with a sense of wonder and improbability.</p>
