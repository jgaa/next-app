# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

During the beta phase, we will not backport security fixes. All fixes will be included in the next scheduled release. For critical vulnerabilities, we will issue a new version immediately once the issue is resolved.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Minor vulnerabilities**: Please open an [issue](https://github.com/jgaa/next-app/issues).
- **Serious vulnerabilities**: Please report via email to [contact@lastviking.eu](mailto:contact@lastviking.eu).
- **Critical vulnerabilities or questions**: Call us at +359 89 426 9175 or contact us on Signal at `@tlv.42`.

> **Please note:** This is an open-source project without any revenue at the moment, so there is no bug-bounty program.
