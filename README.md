# next-app
GTD application for desktop and mobile.

This is a project I have been thinking and talking about for more than 10 years.

I have used a "light" version of David Allans [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com) (GTD) 
ide for even longer. I wrote an app for Android in 2013 [VikingGTD](https://github.com/jgaa/VikingGTD)
that I a still use to organize my life. However, I want something that runs on multiple 
devices - so I can use it on my laptops *and* my phone. I also want it to use location 
and my energy level to suggest the most relevant next action - as well as reminding me abot people to 
ping and tings I need to get from nearby shops when I mode around. 
Not to mention delegation and cooperation with other people.

This is a pretty large project for a lone hacker. It involves a server part, a desktop app, an Android app
and probably an IOS app.

Everything is open source. I will probably offer a hosting-plan for people who don't wan to run
their own back-end. But for people and companies where privacy and security is paramount,
the code for the server and the apps will be freely available.
